## The Aim
The aim is to build a simple webapp kernel for an intranet website with tons of webapp tools.
I plan to take things from collei framework (a later project of mine, "almost" "ready") into this new webapp kernel.

## Current Status
The kernel is in active developement and it's not yet suitable to support any application.
