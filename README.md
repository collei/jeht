## The Aim
The aim is to build a simple webapp kernel for an intranet website with tons of webapp tools.

Things will be taken from collei/framework (a later project of mine, "almost" "ready") into this webapp kernel.

## Current Status
The kernel is in active developement and is not yet suitable to support any serious use.
